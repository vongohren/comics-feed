# Development of app itself

`yarn dev`

Need a DB url in the MONGODB_URI env variable

### Slack development
* You need a representation of the bot on slack apps.
* You need a localhost bridge

##### Localhost bridge
This can be done through `ngrok` or `serveo`    

##### Slack bot app
Need to change the auth, interactive and commands on slack app to a localhost bridge for this to aim to locally running code

# Testing the app
I need to check the rss feeds on the hosted page to see if the database flows
I need to see that it stores the newest comics.
I need to make sure it posts
